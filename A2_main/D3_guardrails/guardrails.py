PE6201 · A2 scaffold — THE GUARDRAIL LAYER  (D3a)
====================================================================
Four things, and NONE of them involve a model. That is the point.

    1. STEP CAP            stop after N turns
    2. BUDGET CEILING      stop after N tokens
    3. ACTION DE-DUPLICATION   stop repeating an action already taken
    4. AUTONOMY GATE       hold the irreversible step for a human

A model cannot influence whether these fire, which is why D3(b)'s ten
guardrail cases run on the SCRIPTED backend. They test your code.

MAKE THE STOP LOUD. A cap that silently returns an empty answer is
worse than the loop it prevented: it turns a visible cost problem into
an invisible correctness problem. Every stop below records WHY.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE(D3/injection): defence against hostile free text lives at the TOOL
  INTERFACE, not as a fifth Guardrails method. get_claim returns
  narrative_injection {found, kinds} so the instruction is FOUND AND
  NOT FOLLOWED; scripts / live routing escalate with trigger
  instruction_in_member_narrative. Grepping only for "ignore" is not
  enough — CLM-8952 imitates a tool result with no imperative verb.

NOTE(D3/monthly-cap): D6 asks for three caps; this layer enforces two
  (step cap, budget ceiling). MONTHLY_LIMIT_PER_USER is a policy
  commitment, not a code control — stated in answers_D6.CAPS and the
  report, deliberately not enforced here. A per-run Guardrails instance
  cannot see cross-run monthly volume; pretending it does would be worse
  than naming the gap.
